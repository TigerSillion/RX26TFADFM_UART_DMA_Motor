# Change Management Rule

- Any change to source, config, build scripts, or docs must be recorded.
- Required records:
  - `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing summary.
  - `docs/CHANGE_RECORDS.md` for engineering detail.
- For `smc_gen` updates, also update `docs/SMC_GEN_MODIFICATIONS.md`.
- Commit is not complete unless the corresponding records exist in the same change set.
